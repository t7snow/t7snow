# :rocket: what am I up to? 

Currently I am a Computer Science student at George Mason University, graduating in 2025 with a bachelors in Computer Science. I am working on a few personal projects that will release here soon. 

## where to read more about me

I am looking to start some blog posts, they will be here soon. 

## what have I done? 

I have started a few businesses, done >100k in sales, and created a lot of applications. Where are they? Most of them are released, but the middle school and highschool Tucker that wrote them made them work, not pretty. So they aren't here, lol.
