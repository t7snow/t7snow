## where to read more about me

I am looking to start some blog posts, they will be here soon. 

## what have I done? 

I have started a few businesses, done >100k in sales, and created a lot of applications. Where are they? Most of them are released and their code is lost. See WTM, NbaBot, SalesFirst, etc.. The code was horrible as well. Here is where I house things now.
